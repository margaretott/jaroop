# Bank Account App
This is a bank account app that allows users to interact using the command line.

It uses a simple while loop to prompt the user to either deposit, withdraw, check the balance, or exit, until it recieves the exit command.

It uses parts of the Scala and Java standard libraries as well as `scala-xml` to parse the initial bank account information from an xml-style html document.

There is an Account class, which represents the bank account, and includes deposit, withdraw, and balance functions.
